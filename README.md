About my experience
------------------
It was first time I used python for development (I wrote some scripts before, but it didn't help a lot)
I have never used django before, but VS provide it with python tools and also VS has built in publish to Azure, 
so I decided to use this stack for development

I was concentrating more on server side, so front-end is not polished.
Also I have to mention, that "actor" processing have to be done in a better way (I would better store actors separately 
and filter with Foreign key)
I had limited amount of time, so also I would add some more tests for corner cases.
All geo location is done with Google API, so some addresses have problems with coordinates (as TODO: clean db for these cases)



Building the Source
